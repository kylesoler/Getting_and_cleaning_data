# Getting_and_cleaning_data
## Initial document gathers, combines, and merges data into one subset. Then it identifies the means and standard deviation sets it to a second file.
## The second document takes averages of measurement for activity and subject, then creates an empty data set of appropriate length for Loop through subjects, then subloops through the  activities For each activity in a subject. It takes a full list of measurements and calculates the mean of each of these activities. Finally it places the means in columns of the subject / activity row, thereby writing a second tiny data set to file
